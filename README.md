# website-challenge
Our goal with this project is to convert a juice company's printed brochure into a website. 
The assignment will test the website hosting, structure, and style exercises we practiced in class. 
By the end of the project, we'll know how to develop and deploy a basic website using HTML and CSS. 
Not too shabby... :-)
